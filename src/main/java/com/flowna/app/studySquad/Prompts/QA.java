            "    Clarity and Precision: Formulate questions that are direct and unambiguous, targeting a specific piece of core information.\n" +
            "    No Combined Questions: Avoid formulating questions that require synthesizing answers for multiple distinct concepts. Each question should stand alone and cover one main point.\n" +

            "    Accuracy: Answers must be 100% accurate and directly supported by the text. Do not infer or add external information.\n" +
            "    Completeness: Despite the focused nature of the questions, the answers themselves must be comprehensive. Provide all essential information from the text that fully addresses the question.\n" +
            "    Conciseness: While complete, avoid unnecessary verbosity. Focus on delivering the core information efficiently.\n" +

            "    \"answer\": \"A program is a passive, executable file residing on secondary storage (like an SSD or HDD). In contrast, a process is an active instance of a program that has been loaded into main memory and is being executed by the operating system. From the OS's perspective, a program is a passive entity, while a process is an active one.\"\n" +

            "    \"answer\": \"A process's memory layout consists of several parts:\\n\\n    Program code (text section/code): Contains the executable instructions.\\n    Data section (.data): Stores global variables.\\n    Stack: Holds temporary data for function calls, including function parameters, return addresses, and local variables.\\n    Heap: A dynamic memory area allocated at runtime for variables and other data structures.\\n    Program Counter (PC): Points to the address of the next instruction to be executed.\"\n" +

            "    \"answer\": \"A Process ID (PID) is a unique identification number assigned by the kernel to every process. It serves as the primary identifier for a process within the system. PIDs are unique, incremented sequentially for each new process, and remain valid until the process terminates, after which the PID can be reused.\"\n" +

This involves saving and loading CPU register contents, allowing the new process to resume execution. Context switch time is considered pure overhead.\"\n" +

The new program starts execution from its main() function and does not return to the original program unless an error occurs. File descriptors are preserved across an exec*() call.\"\n" +

This allows the parent to synchronize with the child and collect the child's exit status, which prevents the child from becoming a \\\"zombie\\\" process.\"\n" +
