Its specific molecular structure is perfectly designed to absorb energy from sunlight, particularly in the blue and red parts of the light spectrum.

            "    C) It has decreased by a factor of 1,000: This gets the magnitude of the change correct but in the wrong direction. A lower pH number means a higher acidity and therefore a higher concentration of hydrogen ions. The solution has become more acidic, not less.\n" +

According to the WHO, COPD is currently the fourth leading cause of death and is expected to rise to third place by 2030. Worldwide, 251.6 million people are affected with 18.7 million new cases in 2016. The incidence rate among smokers is approximately 20%. In Germany alone, seven million people suffer from COPD. The average annual cost associated with COPD is about EUR 3027.00 per patient, and the condition is characterized by recurring acute phases of deterioration (exacerbation) leading to irreversible damage to lung tissue. An exacerbation is a deterioration, temporary increase, or recurrence of an illness. \n" +
